# Microcontroller Programming (Sensors)

This project walks you through the process of connecting and programming multiple sensors to a microcontroller. All individual sensor connections, wiring, procedures, and code are explained in dedicated folders on GitHub. The necessary libraries are also provided in the repository.

### Individual Sensor Connections and Setup

1. **Gravity: DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor**

2. **Gravity: Analog Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Sensor (0-10000 ppm)**


3. **Gravity: NH3 Sensor (Calibrated) - I2C & UART**


4. **Gravity: Electrochemical Oxygen (O2) Sensor (0-25% Vol, I2C)**


5. **Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F Optical Dust Sensor - PM2.5/PM10 Detection**

6. **Optical Sensitive Resistance Light Detection Photosensitive LDR Sensor Module**

### Final Project: Connecting All Sensors Together

- After testing the individual sensors, the final code for integrating all the sensors together can be found in the **"Poultry_Project_Final"** folder on GitHub.

### GitHub Repository

All code, wiring diagrams, and necessary libraries are available in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MDRaselAlMamun/AIoT-Poultry-Farm/tree/main/Microcontroller%20Programming%20(Sensors)). Follow the individual folders for each sensor's connection, wiring, procedure, and code.

By following the instructions in the folders, you will be able to successfully connect and program each sensor to the microcontroller. The provided code and libraries are compatible with most popular microcontrollers like Arduino, and ESP32.
